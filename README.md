Beeb Bomber Man

A BBC Micro port of [NES Bomber Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman_(1983_video_game)) in 6502 assembler. This project was inspired by [a dissasembly of the original NES game](https://github.com/ogamespec/bomberman-nes).

I'm using [MS vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [extensions by Simon.M](https://github.com/simondotm/beeb-vsc), [beebasm](https://github.com/stardot/beebasm), and a mixture of BBC Micro emulators such as [jsbeeb](https://bbc.godbolt.org/) / [beebem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeebEm) / [b2](https://github.com/tom-seddon/b2) and [beebjit](https://github.com/scarybeasts/beebjit).
